  <p>Mahatma Gandhi was a 19th and 20th century Indian lawyer, politician, and thinker (born October 2, 1869, and assassinated on January 30, 1948) known primarily for vindicating and leading the independence of India through nonviolent methods.</p>
  
  <h4><li>Chilhood</li></h4>
  <p>He was born in Porbandar, a small coastal town in western India, as a result of the marriage of Karamchand Gandhi (the city's prime minister) and Putlibai Gandhi. His mother was one of his most important influences in life, because from her he learned respect for living beings, the virtues of vegetarianism and tolerance for different ways of thinking, including other faiths and religions.</p>
  
  <h4><li>Youth</li></h4>
  <p>At the age of 18 he moved to London to study law at University College London. When he finished his studies he returned to Bombay to try to practice as a lawyer, but the oversaturation of the profession at that time coupled with Gandhi's lack of real experience in court made it impossible for him to fulfill that purpose. Luckily, that same year (1893) he was presented with the opportunity to work in South Africa, a job he accepted on the spot motivated by the fight of resistance and non-violent civil disobedience that his compatriots were carrying out before the pressure and discrimination of the country towards the Hindus.</p>
    
   <h4><li>Years in South Africa</li></h4>
  <p>There, in South Africa, Gandhi saw firsthand the strong rejection and hatred towards the Indians, which motivated him in 1894 to create an Indian political party to defend his rights. After 22 years of non-violent protests in South Africa, Gandhi gained enough power and respect to negotiate a solution to the Indian conflict with South African General Jan Christian Smuts.</p>
  
  <h4><li>Back to India</li></h4>
  <p>In 1915 Gandhi returned to India, where he continued to promulgate his religious, philosophical, and especially political values. In recent years, two major social protests stood out: the Salt March (1930) and the demand for India's independence from the British Empire in the framework of the Second World War (1939-1945). The latter, which involuntarily involved India in the war as a British dependency, along with all the years of nonviolent struggle, finally led to the official independence of India on August 15, 1947.</p>
  
  <h4><li>Death</li></h4>
  <p>A few months later, on January 30, 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a government-related Hindu far-right fanatic, who found in Gandhi an obstacle to lifting his project of the rise of Hinduism to the detriment of other beliefs. and religions. In this way, for defending his ideology of an egalitarian society, Gandhi would die assassinated at the age of 78.</p>
